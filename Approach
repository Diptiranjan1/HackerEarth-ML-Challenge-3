PREPROCESSING
1)Initially by making a table between browserid and devid we find that browserid having devid with none value have a single type of device. So we replace it with respective devices.

2)we find leaks in data like siteid = 'IE' and 'Internet Explorer'. We bring these under one category.

3)Fill the none/null values as given in the sample code.


MODEL TRAINING
1) We have 3 models -> CATBOOST 1, LIGHTGBM, CATBOOST 2
2) Data Distribution between these 3 -> CATBOSST 1 -> 4000000
					LIGHTGBM   -> 4000000
					CATBOOST 2 -> 2000000

3) We have made Catboost 1 the strongest followed by lightgbm then catboost 2.
4) Results from each are added according to this equation -
	Probability = (CatBoost1*.41 + Lightgbm*.59)*.41 + Catboost2*.59
